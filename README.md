# Content-Based Recommendation System

We plan to build a movie/show recommendation system using a few kaggle datasets that consist of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. Our model will allow movie and show inputs and output relevant titles from any streaming platform. We will research various papers and datasets to select effective algorithms for the final model and potentially utilize clustering methods to make these recommendations.

## Key Objectives
Develop a movie recommendation system that is not tied to a specific streaming service so that users can find TV shows and movies relevant to their input. Analyze movie descriptions, genres, duration, and cast members to cluster similar content to prioritize recommendations (i.e. someone who enjoys Marvel movies generally can find other shows or movies that are similar in content) In the output of our model, we want to show users the movie and show titles by relevance and by rating. We will determine the titles to show by cluster distance and by rating scores.

## Customer/Users
- Customers: Streaming services who want to adopt a recommendation engine on their platforms
- Users: Individuals who watch movies via streaming services.

## Data
- IMDb movies extensive dataset: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset)
- The Movies Dataset: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv)
- Large Movie Review Dataset: [link](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

## Results
We developed a dashboard which recommends 5 movies depending on a input movie. A user can choose two options: Rating recommendation and Content Recommendation. Rating recommendation sorts 5 movies by ratings, whiel the content recommendation sorts 5 movies by the similarity with the input movie.
